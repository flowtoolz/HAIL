- descriptions of usage situations become first-class design objects
- a scenario shows how a task would be performed with a particular design
- scenarios are useful in problem analysis and solution projection
- analysing user needs: people, place, processes
- stakeholders develop scenarios together (user stories)
- iteratively adjust scenarios by discussing them with users
- hierarchical task analysis (subtasks…)

rosson/carroll: book "usability engineering: scenario-based …"
- scenarios highlight how users persue not only their goals but also the goals suggested by the system (p.17)
- scenarios contain certain elements: p.18
- scenarios are hierarchically structured: high level goal, subgoals
- scenarios are not use cases (p.17-19)
- scenarios (as opposed to use cases) emphasise how goals, plans and understandings change during usage
- scenarios can be created and tested using prototypes (paper, software …)
- usability objectives should be explicit, clear and specific (p.20)
- scenarios are of arbitrary detail to stay flexible and cope with uncertainty
- scenarios help balancing several trade offs (p.21)
- the framework diagram is a waterfall but is meant to be applied iteratively
- design phase is split into 3: activity-, information- and interaction design
